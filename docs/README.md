## Overview
Chingu brings together a number of individuals with a goal to develop a web application of some nature within a six week "voyage". In this Voyage, we were lucky enough to have a team of seven including a user experience and designer as well as a product owner. It is our task to develop a web application that helps a user organize and manage tasks effectively on a day to day basis.
### The Project
The Minimum Viable Product of this application should allow a user to create a task and assign it a date, priority, frequency, and track its' completion. Once a task is created, the user should be able to also delete that task or update it. A dataset is given to the team to work with initially. It should parse the data and provide an interface which allows the user to sort by category, activity type, and individual tasks.

This project is a valuable opportunity for us to gain hands-on experience in web development while handling multi-dimensional datasets. It serves as a grinding stone to hone our skills while working on a practical application, allowing us to delve into the complexities of data manipulation within a web-based environment.

### Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for [development](#developing) and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
live-server
```
### Installing

Our application is does not use any dependencies for deployment therefore it does not need to be installed. However if you like there is a package.json file which leverages a developer dependency of `live-server`.

To install this developer dependency , use the command `npm i` or `npm install`. Alternatively of course this could be donw with `yarn install` as well.


### Developing
In order to enter a development environment use the command `npm start` or `npm run start`, or alternatively `yarn run start` if used as the package manager.
### Deployment

We do not have a deployment build. To deploy the app on a front-end cloud solution such as Netlify, Vercel, AWS, or etc. simply set the publish directory as `public`.
