## Overview

Chingu brings together a number of individuals with a goal to develop a web application within a six-week "voyage". In this Voyage, we had a team of seven, including a user experience designer and a product owner. Our task was to develop a web application that helps users organize and manage tasks effectively on a day-to-day basis.

### The Project

The Minimum Viable Product of this application should allow users to create tasks and assign them a date, priority, frequency, and track their completion. Users should also be able to delete or update tasks. Initially, a dataset is provided to the team, which should be parsed and displayed in an interface that allows users to sort by category, activity type, and individual tasks.

This project provides a valuable opportunity for us to gain hands-on experience in web development while working with multi-dimensional datasets. It serves as a practical application to hone our skills and delve into the complexities of data manipulation within a web-based environment.
