## Overview
Chingu brings together a number of individuals with a goal to develop a web application of some nature within a six week "voyage". In this Voyage, we were lucky enough to have a team of seven including a user experience and designer as well as a product owner. It is our task to develop a web application that helps a user organize and manage tasks effectively on a day to day basis.
### The Project
The Minimum Viable Product of this application should allow a user to create a task and assign it a date, priority, frequency, and track its' completion. Once a task is created, the user should be able to also delete that task or update it. A dataset is given to the team to work with initially. It should parse the data and provide an interface which allows the user to sort by category, activity type, and individual tasks.

This project is a valuable opportunity for us to gain hands-on experience in web development while handling multi-dimensional datasets. It serves as a grinding stone to hone our skills while working on a practical application, allowing us to delve into the complexities of data manipulation within a web-based environment.
