## Overview

Chingu brings together a number of individuals with a goal to develop a web application within a six-week "voyage". In this Voyage, we had a team of seven, including a user experience designer and a product owner. Our task was to develop a web application that helps users organize and manage tasks effectively on a day-to-day basis.

### The Project

The Minimum Viable Product of this application should allow users to create tasks and assign them a date, priority, frequency, and track their completion. Users should also be able to delete or update tasks. Initially, a dataset is provided to the team, which should be parsed and displayed in an interface that allows users to sort by category, activity type, and individual tasks.

This project provides a valuable opportunity for us to gain hands-on experience in web development while working with multi-dimensional datasets. It serves as a practical application to hone our skills and delve into the complexities of data manipulation within a web-based environment.

### Getting started

These instructions will guide you to set up and run the project on your local machine for [development](#developing) and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
live-server
```
### Installing

Our application is does not use any dependencies for deployment therefore it does not need to be installed. However if you like there is a package.json file which leverages a developer dependency of `live-server`.

To install this developer dependency , use the command `npm i` or `npm install`. Alternatively of course this could be donw with `yarn install` as well.


### Developing
In order to enter a development environment use the command `npm start` or `npm run start`, or alternatively `yarn run start` if used as the package manager.
### Deployment

We do not have a deployment build. To deploy the app on a front-end cloud solution such as Netlify, Vercel, AWS, or etc. simply set the publish directory as `public`.
