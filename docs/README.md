## Overview
Chingu brings together a number of individuals with a goal to develop a web application of some nature within a six week "voyage". In this Voyage, we were lucky enough to have a team of seven including a user experience and designer as well as a product owner. It is our task to develop a web application that helps a user organize and manage tasks effectively on a day to day basis.
### The Project
The Minimum Viable Product of this application should allow a user to create a task and assign it a date, priority, frequency, and track its' completion. Once a task is created, the user should be able to also delete that task or update it. A dataset is given to the team to work with initially. It should parse the data and provide an interface which allows the user to sort by category, activity type, and individual tasks.

This project is a valuable opportunity for us to gain hands-on experience in web development while handling multi-dimensional datasets. It serves as a grinding stone to hone our skills while working on a practical application, allowing us to delve into the complexities of data manipulation within a web-based environment.

#### `documentation`
 Houses all of the documentation for the project primarily the `docs` folder. 
 - A deployment of `documentation` can be found on GitHub Pages at 

#### `production`
 The production branch is where we push code that has passed all quality checks and is in production working to the public.
 - A deployment of `production` is found on Netlify at [https://v47-tier1-team-04.netlify.app/](https://v47-tier1-team-04.netlify.app/).
 - Requires 3 approvals to merge pull request into
#### `development`
 This branch is a representation of the code that is on deck to be deployed the following week. It has passed all quality checks but is awaiting all changes from the rest of the Sprint objectives to move forward into `production`.
 - A deployment of `development` is found on Netlify at [https://v47-tier1-team-04-dev.netlify.app/](https://v47-tier1-team-04-dev.netlify.app/).
 - Requires 2 approvals to merge pull request into
#### `beta`
 This branch represents code that has passed through the `alpha` stage of testing. Thorough testing of the application should be occurring while the code is within this branch. This should happen before a pull request is made into `development`.
 - A deployment of `beta` is found on Netlify at [https://v47-tier1-team-04-beta.netlify.app/](https://v47-tier1-team-04-beta.netlify.app/).
 - Requires 1 approvals to merge pull request into
#### `alpha`
 The default branch for our repository. This branch is where code will be taken to be tested against all other code. All proposed code should enter this staging area first to be compared against other code. This staging area is a filter for catching merge conflicts and to spot bugs that may arise from resolution.
 - A deployment of `alpha` is found on Netlify at [https://v47-tier1-team-04-alpha.netlify.app/](https://v47-tier1-team-04-alpha.netlify.app/).
