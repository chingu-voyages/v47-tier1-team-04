## Overview

Chingu Voyage 47 is a six-week project where a team of seven individuals, including a user experience designer and a product owner, developed a web application for organizing and managing daily tasks effectively.

### The Project

The Minimum Viable Product of this application allows users to create tasks, assign them a date, priority, frequency, and track their completion. Users can also delete or update tasks. The team was provided with a dataset, which was parsed and displayed in an interface that allows users to sort by category, activity type, and individual tasks.

This project provided an opportunity for the team to gain hands-on experience in web development and work with multi-dimensional datasets. It served as a practical application to hone their skills and delve into the complexities of data manipulation within a web-based environment.

### Getting Started

These instructions will guide you to set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

#### Prerequisites

To install and run the software, you will need the following:

- `live-server`

#### Installing

Our application does not use any dependencies for deployment, so it does not need to be installed. However, if you like, there is a `package.json` file which leverages a developer dependency of `live-server`.

To install this developer dependency, use the command `npm i` or `npm install`. Alternatively, you can use `yarn install` as well.

#### Developing

To enter a development environment, use the command `npm start` or `npm run start`. Alternatively, you can use `yarn run start` if you are using Yarn as the package manager.

#### Deployment

We do not have a deployment build. To deploy the app on a front-end cloud solution such as Netlify, Vercel, AWS, etc., simply set the publish directory as `public`.
